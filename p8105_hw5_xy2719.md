## Problem 1

``` r
birthdays = sample(1:365, 5, replace = TRUE)

repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < 5

repeated_bday
```

    ## [1] FALSE

Write a function.

``` r
bday_sim = function(n_room) {
  
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)

  repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room

  repeated_bday
  
}

bday_sim(20)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

Run the function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50.

``` r
bday_sim_results = 
  expand_grid(
    bdays = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |>
  mutate(
    result = map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim)
  ) |>
  group_by(
    bdays
  ) |>
  summarize(
    prob_repeat = mean(result)
  )
```

Make a plot showing the probability.

``` r
problem1_p =
  bday_sim_results |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()

Desciption: As group size increases, the probability that at least two
people share a birthday rises rapidly from near 0 and becomes
surprisingly large even for moderate group sizes. Around 20–25 people
the probability is already close to 50%, and by about 40–50 people it is
very close to 1.

Description: Power increases monotonically with the true effect size μ:
as μ moves farther from 0, the test rejects H₀ more often. At μ = 0
power is ~α (≈0.05), and by μ around 5–6 it approaches 1 given n = 30
and σ = 5.

The sample average of μ across all simulations is approximately equal to
the true μ, showing that the estimator is unbiased. However, the average
μ among only those samples where the null was rejected is biased
upward—it tends to overestimate the true effect because significant
results preferentially come from samples with unusually large observed
means.
